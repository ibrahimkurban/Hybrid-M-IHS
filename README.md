# Hybrid-M-IHS
This repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the Hybrid M-IHS variants that are proposed for large scale regularized least squares problems. The details of the solvers can be found in the following manuscript:
  * To be added
## Packages for full functionality
The followings are needed to create example problems and solving them by using conventional hybrid methods such as Hybrid LSQR
  * [IR Tools](https://github.com/jnagy1/IRtools)
  * [AIR Tools II](https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII)
The following is needed for C-based implementation of the Gram-Schmidt procedure
  * [PROPACK](http://sun.stanford.edu/~rmunk/PROPACK/)
